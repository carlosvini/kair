Turin - PHP transpiler
====

Under development. 

Goals
----

* Add chainning to types such as *items:a.filter().implode()* (no neet to wait for the PHP team to add autoboxing!)
* Add automatic conversion between Turin and PHP with Sublime Plugin (other programmers don't even need to know)
* Add shortcuts to *$this* and *self* (@property = 1)
* Remove **$** from variables (var = 1)
* Change **->** and **::** to **.** (concatenate with ~)
